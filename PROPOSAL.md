# Proposal

## App description

We are making a banking application using user authentication. We will be serving static HTML pages for the front end. We are using Sequelize and MySQL for the database and modelling. At the homepage the user can login or sign up. When they user signs in, they will see their banking accounts (checking, savings, etc), and each banking account shows a history of the transactions and categories of the transactions.
